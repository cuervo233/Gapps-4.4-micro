# For Nexus is now integrated into the regular packages
As of the 4th of September 2015 the regular packages offer the same functionality as the For Nexus package did.

For more information you can check the XDA thread:

## Outdated information
The For Nexus Package is a special variant of the regular [['Stock'|Package-Comparison]] package, **intended to only be used on Google's Nexus devices, with the 'normal' stock Android firmware installed**.
It can be ***carefully*** used on non-Nexus devices and on ROMs that also includes all or some GApps, but the compatibility is not guaranteed.

All the support requests should be posted in that thread and not in the official Open GApps thread.

Note: On Moto devices, the Camera and Gallery apps will be removed if you install Google Photos and Camera.
