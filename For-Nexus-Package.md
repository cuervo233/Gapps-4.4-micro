The For Nexus Package is a special variant of the regular [['Stock'|Package-Comparison]] package, intended to only be used on Google's Nexus devices, with the 'normal' stock Android firmware installed.
It can be ***carefully*** used on non-Nexus devices and on ROMs that also includes all or some GApps, but the compatibility is not guaranteed.
For more information you can check the XDA thread:

All the support requests should be posted in that thread and not in the official Open GApps thread.
