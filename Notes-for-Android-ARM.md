Open GApps does not differentiate the `armeabi` and `armeabi-v7a` APKs and prefers the `armeabi-v7a` for the ARM-architecture when adding APKs to the *arm* repository. This implies that Open GApps are only compatible with devices that support the `armeabi-v7a` architecture (with *NEON*). Luckily over 99.9% of the ARM devices that have Android 4.4 (KitKat) ROMs are compatible. There are however a few incompatible chipsets around (like the Tegra2) that do not meet this requirement and are unsupported by Open GApps.
