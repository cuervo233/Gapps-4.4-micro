Because Android x86 does still miss some Google applications, not all applications are available in the [[full|Full-Package]] and [[stock|Stock-Package]] package.
At the moment the set of missing applications consists of:
* Android Pay
* Wallet
* Face Unlock
* Google Camera
* Sound Search for Google Play
* Street View is outdated, only the legacy version is available.
