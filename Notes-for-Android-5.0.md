Because AOSP builds of Android 5.0 do not support the usage of an alternative Google WebView installation, the 5.0 [[stock|Stock-Package]] package does not include Google WebView. The [[for nexus|For-Nexus-Package]] package does have Google WebView included, since on those firmwares it can just replace the native installation.
